## A Simple Calculater For Daily Use
<h3>
The calculator is a web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for performing basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more advanced operations like square root, exponentiation, percentage, and constants like Pi and Euler's number.

The calculator's interface consists of a text input field for displaying the calculations and the results, and a set of buttons for performing various arithmetic and mathematical operations. The buttons are arranged in a grid-like layout, with each button labeled with a specific number or operation symbol.

To use the calculator, users can simply click the buttons to input numbers and operators, and the result will be displayed instantly in the input field. Users can also clear the input field using the "C" button, and calculate the result using the "=" button.

The calculator's design is sleek and minimalistic, with a neutral color scheme and simple button icons that make it easy to use and understand. It is suitable for both casual and professional use, and can be used to perform calculations for everyday tasks or more complex mathematical operations.
